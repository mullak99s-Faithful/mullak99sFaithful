    Customisation
*******************************

If you don't want some of the CTM features but you do want others then you
have to open the zip and the contained "ctm" folder then delete
the folders containing the things you don't like.

With the contents of the folder called "default" you need to delete files ending 
in ".properties" for the features you don't like. For example: deleting the 
"glass.properties" file will remove the connected glass.
