~~ Vattic's Usage Guidelines ~~

It's fine for people to use stuff from the Faithful 32x32 pack so long as guidelines bellow are followed.

Things that are fine:
- Use as placeholders.
- Using as many textures as you've made yourself.
- Using the items or paintings.
- Use as base for mod textures.

Requirements:
- Give clear credit.
- Link back to the Faithful 32x32 thread.
- Be honest about what you are using.
- No money making links.

On remix/tweaked packs:
- Let's Players can share a modified copy with fans.
- Adventure map makers can provide modified copy to go along with it.

If either of the above apply:
- You must distribute through YouTube video descriptions or your series'/map's forum topic and not create a separate thread for the pack.
- To avoid people uploading a video just so they can upload a copy of the pack Let's Players must have a decent number of videos that use the pack and a decent number of subscribers.

Finally:
- If I decide I don't want you using stuff from the pack then that is final. This will only be the case in unusual circumstances.
- These guidelines can be changed at any time.
