~~ Vattic's Usage Guidelines ~~

It's fine for people to use stuff from the Faithful 32x32 pack so long as guidelines bellow are followed.

Things that are fine:
- Use as placeholders.
- Using as many textures as you've made yourself.
- Using the items or paintings.
- Use as base for mod textures.

Requirements:
- Give clear credit.
- Link back to the Faithful 32x32 thread.
- Be honest about what you are using.
- No money making links.

On remix/tweaked packs:
- Let's Players can share a modified copy with fans.
- Adventure map makers can provide modified copy to go along with it.

If either of the above apply:
- You must distribute through YouTube video descriptions or your series'/map's forum topic and not create a separate thread for the pack.
- To avoid people uploading a video just so they can upload a copy of the pack Let's Players must have a decent number of videos that use the pack and a decent number of subscribers.

Finally:
- If I decide I don't want you using stuff from the pack then that is final. This will only be the case in unusual circumstances.
- These guidelines can be changed at any time.

Noteworthy Mentions and Credits:

Vattic - Faithful 32x (Base textures and Major Inspiration)
xMrVizzy/Faithful Team - Faithful 32x (Keeping the original Vattic pack updated)
Faithful Community - Faithful 32x (Creating textures for latest/snapshot versions)
AntVenom - FaithfulVenom (Major Inspiration)
Dowsey/JustJoshy - Dowsey's Faithful (Inspiration for GUI)

Honestly, I cannot reasonably list the amount of noteworthy mentions and other credits. 
The community in the Faithful Team Discord are responsible for many of the snapshot textures that not 
only make it into my Faithful 32x, but my pack before they are officially added to Faithful 32x.

A majority of this pack would not exist if not for Vattic, xMrVizzy (and the Faithful Team), and the other 
members of the Faithful Discord.
