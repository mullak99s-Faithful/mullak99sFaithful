[EM32D](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/em32d/) for creating the Emulated Vattic packs (Post-1.9 textures)  
[Compliance Team](https://compliancepack.net/) for creating the Compliance pack (Post-1.9 textures)  
[AntVenom](https://antvenom.com/files) for creating the FaithfulVenom pack (Major Inspiration)  
The community in the "Compliance 32x" Discord, as well as the "Emulated Vattic Textures" Discord for maintaining Vattic's original Faithful.  

Honestly, I cannot reasonably list the amount of noteworthy mentions and other credits.   

A majority of this pack would not exist if not for Vattic, the [Compliance Team](https://compliancepack.net/), and the [Emulated Vattic Team](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/em32d/).
